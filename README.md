KALI ON WHEELS is an UGV *(unmanned ground vehicle)* platform which runs Kali Linux. It gives freedom for a penetration tester to perform Red Teaming activity from anywhere as long as both the devices have a stable internet connection. KOW is built around a SOC *(Raspberry Pi)* but it could be ported to any SOC or an Android phone for simplicity.

#### Usage

- Pentesting in hazardous environments.
- Low profile of KOW  makes it easier to stay hidden and the ability to shutdown peripherals extends the performance time.
- KOW can stay dormant for up to a month.
- Ability to gather information with on-board camera and the ability to see in the dark with IR flashlights.
- Quickly change position with high torque 4-WD Actuators.
- Ardupilot Mission Planner helps in Autonomous navigation.
- Can disrupt a business by performing WiFi De-Auth attack for 72 Hours.
- Can perform packet capture for 72 Hours on any frequency using onboard SDR (software defined radio) which is not limited to  just bluetooth and WiFi, also the Digital and Analog low power radio communications (Walkie Talkies) could be demodulated in realtime to eavesdrop on the radio voice communication.
- Anything you could possibly imagine doing on a kali box from a safe distance.
