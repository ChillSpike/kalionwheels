KALI ON WHEELS is an UGV *(unmanned ground vehicle)* platform which runs kali linux. It gives freedom for a penetration tester to perform Red Teaming activity from anywhere as long as both the devices have a stable internet connection. KOW is built around a SOC *(Raspberry Pi)* but it could be ported to any SOC or an Android phone for simplicity.

##### Features
- Kali-Rolling Repository.
- On-board 1080p camera with 2-axis servo.
- NEO-6M GPS receiver.
- 4WD 1/18 scale rover.
- 20000 mAh Li-Ion power backup.
- Power Management System.
- on-board Realtek RTL8812AU supports packet injection.
- 4G-LTE network module.
- Realtek RTLSDR - Software Defined Radio Module.
- IR Blaster and Flash Light.
- Hero Core Microcontroller Atmega 2560.

##### Usage

- Pentesting in hazardous environments.
- Low profile of KOW  makes it easier to stay hidden and the ability to shutdown pheripherals extends the performance time.
- KOW can stay dormant for upto a month.
- Ability to gather information with on-board camera and the ability to see in the dark with IR flashlights.
- Quickly change position with High torque 4-WD Actuators.
- Ardupilot Mission Planner helps in Autonomous navigation.
- Can disrupt a business by performing WiFi deauth attack for 72 Hours.
- Can perform packet capture for 72 Hours on any frequency using onboard SDR (software defined radio) which is not limited to bluetooth and WiFi, also the Digital and Analog low power radio communications (walkie talkies) could be demodulated in realtime to evesdrop on the blue team communications.
- Anything you could possibly imagine doing on a kali box from a safe distance.
